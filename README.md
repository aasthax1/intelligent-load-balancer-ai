# 🚀 Intelligent Load Balancer (AI-Powered)

An AI-driven intelligent load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple servers using **real-time metrics** (CPU, RAM, latency, active connections) and **machine learning predictions**.  
This project blends **Networking + Full Stack + DevOps + AI**, making it a strong **FAANG-level portfolio project**.

---

## ⭐ Overview

Traditional load balancers rely on static algorithms like **Round Robin** or **Least Connections**.

This project introduces an **adaptive, predictive load balancer** that can:

- 🔮 Predict server load before it spikes  
- ⚡ Route traffic to the most optimal server  
- 🛡️ Auto-failover if a server goes down  
- 📈 Learn from historical data to improve decisions  

A **React dashboard** provides real-time visualization of server health and routing patterns.
