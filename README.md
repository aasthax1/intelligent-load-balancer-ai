🚀 Intelligent Load Balancer (AI-Powered)

An AI-driven intelligent load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple servers using real-time metrics (CPU, RAM, latency, active connections) and machine learning predictions.
This project combines Networking + Full Stack + DevOps + AI, making it a strong portfolio project for FAANG-level interviews.

⭐ Overview

Traditional load balancers rely on static algorithms such as Round Robin or Least Connections.
This project introduces an adaptive, predictive load balancing system that can:

🔮 Predict server load before it spikes

⚡ Route traffic to the most optimal server

🛡️ Automatically failover on server failure

📈 Learn from past data to improve routing decisions

A React dashboard provides real-time visualization of server health and routing paths.
